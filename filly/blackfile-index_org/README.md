“If I’m lost, the backup coordinates can be found on Earth near where east meets west: An ancient sea bridge, an island between B and C, bodies both. I have a yankee sixth sense about it. Two ivory towns. Carry the cross into the Mine, just the whole numbers, sixty three times raise the parallel, just twice the long.”
